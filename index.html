This did not take too long to figure out, but I had to delete and readd certain items from the folder to finally get the favicon to work. Not too bad only around 5 minutes 
I of course had to change the title to something more befitting to what I am going to write about. --!>

  <text>I would like to introduce myself as Junfeng Pan. I come from Fuzhou, China and moved to the US when I was around two. I settled in Brooklyn, New York for around eight years before I moved to Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania I moved around two more times until I settled down in Mechanicsburg, PA. Currently I am a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, where I intend to pursue a career in med. I am a very simple guy that enjoys a variety of things, for example, listening to music, cooking, playing video games, volleyball, basketball, and learning about the cultures, languages, and history of certain countries.
  I currently do not spend much of my free time doing much other than maybe rarely going out with people I met from ASA and CASA. These both are clubs about the culture of Asian and Chinese American people, respectively. Other than that I feel as if I need to make an impact in my community, so I am most likely going to join med related clubs, and maybe start volunteering at hospitals, hospice, and maybe retirement homes. I don't know, maybe I will do pharmacy things, as I am not too sure as to what I am doing currently. All I know is that I want to do something in med, so I can help my community.</div>

  <p>So, basically I don't have a pet with me of course, since I don't have an emotional support pet. However, I do have fishes. I never named them with my parents, so the fishes are nameless, but definitely there. I like the spongebob decor, and the shark the best. As for the cat, it was never mine, but I would like to say that I did have to take care of him, his name is Buns. I took care of Buns for my brother, and he was sadly kidnapped away from me, because of my brother. He is still eating well and living well, still very cute. My brother also got another cat, that looks the same, but unfortunately I didn't get any photos of him. His name is Kiwi.</p>

I show my keyboard here, because it is dear to me. The keyboard was made from my friend that gifted it to me for my birthday. There was a former keyboard that was made by him as well. It was a pink and white sakura keyboard that worked and felt very good for its price.</p>

<!-- So, yeah, I absolutely abhor this process. I tried to incorporate code that would allow you to just see the essay, but it just kept on saying something about not compatible and when I looked up the solution to it, it was something about the flash needing to be updated. 
After that, I just had oh so much fun with word. I think I hate word, literally the first time I would say something like that. This is probably because I am not familiar with it, but I just much prefer docs. Anyways, this process took way too long, even longer than some of the time spent on the code 
Oh great. I ran into another problem. I'm sorry, but I'm very fed with this assignment at this point, and am just venting my anger. I will not attempt to fix this problem this time, and just call it quits. The problem comes with how long the url is, and it just goes off into space. Just lovely. 
I've already spent around 6 hours on this assignment and refuse to spend anymore time. I don't even want to change the url's color!-->
<div class="textblock">
  <p>For my first essay, I wrote an enconium about keyboards. The essay incorporates my love for keyboards and explanation of why the keyboard is such a good item that isn't just a day to day tool that helps you along your journey.</p>
  <!-- I really wanted a darker, bolder color for the essay, so I wanted it to be black, but found out that black was too bold. So I went for darker gray. I spent a really long time on changing the color. --!>
  <p style = "color: #63666A;">Keyboards are used daily, in one form or another. For example,  digital keyboards on a smartphone, or a physical keyboard that types millions of emails each day . The physical keyboard is more than just a tool to type, but an extension to everyone’s lives. As an extension, it is not necessary but could be beneficial. Today, electronics are used every single day in some form or another , either for professional use or leisure use, and to accompany most electronics, a keyboard is used. To write this essay, a keyboard is used. To get into a computer, the keyboard is used to type the password that allows entry into the computer. The keyboard is an item that is the passageway to many things that people have been ignorant about. The keyboard is used for many things that are not even the slightest looked at or praised, for example, innovation, inspiration, and a hobby.</p>
  <p style = "color: #63666A;">To begin looking at a keyboard, going back to the roots of the invention that inspired the keyboard is necessary. The typewriter is the archaic father of the keyboard, patented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. The original typewriter only had 28 keys that were heavily influenced by a piano’s layout. The format of the typewriter changed three more times until it closely resembled the main parts of the keyboard currently: the most popularly known keyboard format; QWERTY (not including the F keys and the extra keys to the right of the enter key) (Brahambhatt). To give credit where credit is due, the invention of the QWERTY typewriter brought forth many pieces of history as physical copies, however, imagine if the people currently were to use typewriters to write an essay. The difficulties of just removing a singular mistake are abysmal.  With the invention of the modern QWERTY keyboard, the singular mistake could be easily removed with the stroke of a key, and just as if nothing happened, people could continue back on track to what they were doing.  Comparatively, the importance of keyboards cannot be overlooked. When working on a certain task has there ever been a moment of eureka that occurs, but not acted upon? The same idea goes for keyboards.</p>
  <p style = "color: #63666A;">People have been pondering since the existence of humans, and there is no difference when it comes to keyboards. To explain the simple rundown   of the inner mechanisms of the modern keyboard is that there  are batteries, a simple printed circuit board and a microprocessor. When the keys are pressed, the keys send three volts of electricity through the conductive lines to be sent to the microprocessor (Branch Education 00:01:06-00:02:05). Through this interaction the microprocessor sends information to the main processor which then puts the information on the screen. The video’s explanation is much more intriguing compared to the simple rundown, and with the complexities of such an item, there is bound to be some inspiration to someone . On a larger scale, the intrigue could turn into something much larger, this could be an opportunity for people to pursue a certain field related to hardware or even a hobby.</p>
  <p style = "color: #63666A;">How might a keyboard be a hobby?  This question may have formed when reading the last sentence of the introduction paragraph. There are many ways a keyboard can be a hobby.  The simplicities and complexities in building a keyboard and modifying a keyboard could both be ways a keyboard could be a hobby.  Building a keyboard from its components, previously stated in the second paragraph, could just be as interesting as putting together a car, but much less labor intensive. The simplicity of putting the keycaps on a keyboard, to the complexities of soldering certain parts of the circuit board in a keyboard could not just be calming but also in other aspects earn the person money by selling their creations . Having the viability of changing certain aspects of a keyboard for example, tape modding, lubing, coin modding, foam modding, band-aid modding, o-ring mods, holee mod, changing the keyboard itself, changing the switches and a bunch more things that could be done to adjust the satisfactory levels of the keyboard to the person’s liking (Bonifield and Coke). There are infinite amounts of modifications that can be done to a mechanical QWERTY keyboard is as intriguing as, for example, crocheting, where there are multiple skill sets that can be learned from and mastered, however, for keyboards, not one thing is certainly “mastered.” The product that is produced can have multiple intricacies that are easily failed, and that is why the hobby of keyboards is so intriguing. </p> 
  <p style = "color: #63666A;">From modifying a keyboard as a hobby, to the keyboard being an inspiration, the keyboard is a multifaceted object that should be reconsidered. The keyboard is also a much better product compared to the archaic typewriter that required much effort to revise a mistake. When looking at a keyboard the next time, think back to the ways it has evolved, and the multiple ways it can contribute to society. Do the same with everything, question everything.</p>
