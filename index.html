This did not take too long to figure out, but I had to delete and readd certain items from the folder to finally get the favicon to work. Not too bad only around 5 minutes 
I of course had to change the title to something more befitting to what I am going to write about. --!>

  <text>I would like to introduce myself as Junfeng Pan. I come from Fuzhou, China and moved to the US when I was around two. I settled in Brooklyn, New York for around eight years before I moved to Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania I moved around two more times until I settled down in Mechanicsburg, PA. Currently I am a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, where I intend to pursue a career in med. I am a very simple guy that enjoys a variety of things, for example, listening to music, cooking, playing video games, volleyball, basketball, and learning about the cultures, languages, and history of certain countries.
  I currently do not spend much of my free time doing much other than maybe rarely going out with people I met from ASA and CASA. These both are clubs about the culture of Asian and Chinese American people, respectively. Other than that I feel as if I need to make an impact in my community, so I am most likely going to join med related clubs, and maybe start volunteering at hospitals, hospice, and maybe retirement homes. I don't know, maybe I will do pharmacy things, as I am not too sure as to what I am doing currently. All I know is that I want to do something in med, so I can help my community.</div>

  <p>So, basically I don't have a pet with me of course, since I don't have an emotional support pet. However, I do have fishes. I never named them with my parents, so the fishes are nameless, but definitely there. I like the spongebob decor, and the shark the best. As for the cat, it was never mine, but I would like to say that I did have to take care of him, his name is Buns. I took care of Buns for my brother, and he was sadly kidnapped away from me, because of my brother. He is still eating well and living well, still very cute. My brother also got another cat, that looks the same, but unfortunately I didn't get any photos of him. His name is Kiwi.</p>

  <p style="color: #32CD32;	 text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 1px black, 1px 0 black, 0 -1px black;;">I like a variety of things, be it playing video games, listening to music, and participating in volleyball and basketball games with my friends. I show my keyboard here, because it is dear to me. The keyboard was made from my friend that gifted it to me for my birthday. There was a former keyboard that was made by him as well. It was a pink and white sakura keyboard that worked and felt very good for its price.</p>

<!-- So, yeah, I absolutely abhor this process. I tried to incorporate code that would allow you to just see the essay, but it just kept on saying something about not compatible and when I looked up the solution to it, it was something about the flash needing to be updated. 
After that, I just had oh so much fun with word. I think I hate word, literally the first time I would say something like that. This is probably because I am not familiar with it, but I just much prefer docs. Anyways, this process took way too long, even longer than some of the time spent on the code 
Oh great. I ran into another problem. I'm sorry, but I'm very fed with this assignment at this point, and am just venting my anger. I will not attempt to fix this problem this time, and just call it quits. The problem comes with how long the url is, and it just goes off into space. Just lovely. 
I've already spent around 6 hours on this assignment and refuse to spend anymore time. I don't even want to change the url's color!-->
<div class="textblock">
  <p>For my first essay, I wrote an enconium about keyboards. First off, you would need the link to the essay to view it, so here it is https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/jup144_pitt_edu/Documents/Jun%27s%20Self%20Revision.docx?d=w1eafb4c401854b4192c193a3d1bf3038&csf=1&web=1&e=frDQ4f </p>
  <p>The essay incorporates my love for keyboards and explanation of why the keyboard is such a good item that isn't just a day to day tool that helps you along your journey.</p>
